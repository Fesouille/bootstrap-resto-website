*Exercice realized from the 18 february 2019 to 21 february 2019, as a project for the formation [BeCode](https://www.becode.org/) to be a Web Developper*


* Project:
For this project, we have to realize a game based on the famous [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). As our first game, we don't have to make it 100% similar, but we have a list of given functionalities to create (such as 'the multiplier', 'the autoclicker', 'the bonus'). In order to achieve this project in group, we made use of [Trello](https://trello.com/) as our Kanban tool.
